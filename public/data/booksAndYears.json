      "description": "The relationship between story and game, and related questions of electronic writing and play, examined through a series of discussions among new media creators and theorists  Electronic games have established a huge international market, significantly outselling non digital games; people spend more money on The Sims than on  Monopoly  or even on  Magic  the Gathering   Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature  predicted by some to be the future of the written word   languishes  Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of  Riding the Bullet  and  The Plant   Isn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games   those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme  can be seen as examples of electronic literature  And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be  like games  so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper like  e books   The editors of First Person have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between  story  and  game,  as well as the new kinds of artistic creation  literary, performative, playful  that have become possible in the digital environment  This landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses  Topics considered range from  Cyberdrama  to  Ludology   the study of games , to  The Pixel/The Line  to  Beyond Chat   The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a First Person web site  created in conjunction with the online journal Electronic Book Review  ",

      "description": "\u201cHow do we think \u201d N  Katherine Hayles poses this question at the beginning of this bracing exploration of the idea that we think through, with, and alongside media  As the age of print passes and new technologies appear every day, this proposition has become far more complicated, particularly for the traditionally print based disciplines in the humanities and qualitative social sciences  With a rift growing between digital scholarship and its print based counterpart, Hayles argues for contemporary technogenesis the belief that humans and technics are coevolving and advocates for what she calls comparative media studies, a new approach to locating digital work within print traditions and vice versa  Hayles examines the evolution of the field from the traditional humanities and how the digital humanities are changing academic scholarship, research, teaching, and publication  She goes on to depict the neurological consequences of working in digital media, where skimming and scanning, or \u201chyper reading,\u201d and analysis through machine algorithms are forms of reading as valid as close reading once was  Hayles contends that we must recognize all three types of reading and understand the limitations and possibilities of each  In addition to illustrating what a comparative media perspective entails, Hayles explores the technogenesis spiral in its full complexity  She considers the effects of early databases such as telegraph code books and confronts our changing perceptions of time and space in the digital age, illustrating this through three innovative digital productions Steve Tomasula\u2019s electronic novel, TOC; Steven Hall\u2019s The Raw Shark Texts; and Mark Z  Danielewski\u2019s Only Revolutions  Deepening our understanding of the extraordinary transformative powers digital technologies have placed in the hands of humanists, How We Think presents a cogent rationale for tackling the challenges facing the humanities today ",

      "description": "Over the past few decades, we have witnessed the growth of movements using digital means to connect with broader interest groups and express their points of view  These movements emerge out of distinct contexts and yield different outcomes, but tend to share one thing in common  online and offline solidarity shaped around the public display of emotion  Social media facilitate feelings of engagement, in ways that frequently make people feel re energized about politics  In doing so, media do not make or break revolutions but they do lend emerging, storytelling publics their own means for feeling their way into events, frequently by making those involved a part of the developing story  Technologies network us but it is our stories that connect us to each other, making us feel close to some and distancing us from others  Affective Publics explores how storytelling practices facilitate engagement among movements tuning into a current issue or event by employing three case studies  Arab Spring movements, various iterations of Occupy, and everyday casual political expressions as traced through the archives of trending topics on Twitter  It traces how affective publics materialize and disband around connective conduits of sentiment every day and find their voice through the soft structures of feeling sustained by societies  Using original quantitative and qualitative data, Affective Publics demonstrates, in this groundbreaking analysis, that it is through these soft structures that affective publics connect, disrupt, and feel their way into everyday politics ",

      "description": "Given the advanced state of digital technology and social media, one would think that the Democratic and Republican Parties would be reasonably well  matched in terms of their technology uptake and sophistication  But as past presidential campaigns have shown, this is not the case  So what explains this odd disparity  Political scientists have shown that Republicans effectively used the strategy of party building and networking to gain campaign and electoral advantage throughout the twentieth century  In Prototype Politics, Daniel Kreiss argues that contemporary campaigning has entered a new technology intensive era that the Democratic Party has engaged to not only gain traction against the Republicans, but to shape the new electoral context and define what electoral participation means in the twenty first century  Prototype Politics provides an analytical framework for understanding why and how campaigns are newly  technology intensive,  and why digital media, data, and analytics are at the forefront of contemporary electoral dynamics  The book discusses the importance of infrastructure, the contexts within which technological innovation happens, and how the collective making of prototypes shapes parties and their technological futures  Drawing on an analysis of the careers of 629 presidential campaign staffers from 2004 2012, as well as interviews with party elites on both sides of the aisle, Prototype Politics details how and why the Democrats invested more in technology, were able to attract staffers with specialized expertise to work in electoral politics, and founded an array of firms to diffuse technological innovations down ballot and across election cycles  Taken together, this book shows how the differences between the major party campaigns on display in 2012 were shaped by their institutional histories since 2004, as well as that of their extended network of allied organizations  In the process, this book argues that scholars need to understand how technological development around politics happens in time and how the dynamics on display during presidential cycles are the outcome of longer processes ",

Tracing the genealogy of rhythm science, Miller cites sources and influences as varied as Ralph Waldo Emerson   all minds quote  , Grandmaster Flash, W  E  B Dubois, James Joyce, and Eminem   The story unfolds while the fragments coalesce,  he writes  Miller's textual provocations are designed for maximum visual and tactile seduction by the international studio COMA  Cornelia Blatter and Marcel Hermans   They sustain the book's motifs of recontextualizing and relayering, texts and images bleed through from page to page, creating what amount to 2 5 dimensional vectors  From its remarkable velvet flesh cover, to the die cut hole through the center of the book, which reveals the colored nub holding in place the included audio CD, Rhythm Science  Excerpts and Allegories from the Sub Rosa Archives, this pamphlet truly lives up to Editorial Director Peter Lunenfeld's claim that the Mediawork Pamphlets are  theoretical fetish objects       'zines for grown ups  ",
